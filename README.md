**WALMART SALES ANALYSIS USING MYSQL**

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart's historical sales data using MySQL to extract meaningful insights. The goal is to understand top-performing branches and products, customer buying behavior, and how different time periods and holidays affect sales.

By executing various SQL queries on the dataset, we aim to answer key business questions and suggest strategies to improve sales performance.

## üìÅ Dataset Source

The data for this project comes from a public Kaggle competition organized by Walmart. It includes historical sales data for 45 stores across various departments and includes holiday markdowns, which add complexity to sales forecasting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Database**: MySQL (queries written and tested using MySQL Workbench)
- **Language**: SQL
- **Platform**: Local machine

## üóÇÔ∏è About Data

This dataset contains sales transactions from three different Walmart branches, located in **Mandalay**, **Yangon**, and **Naypyitaw**. It includes **17 columns** and **1000 rows** of data.

## üìä Key Analysis Performed

- Top-performing branches based on total revenue
- Best-selling product categories
- Daily, weekly, and monthly sales trend analysis
- Customer purchase patterns (time of day, day of week)

## üß≠ Project Workflow & Methodology

To analyze the Walmart sales dataset effectively, I followed a structured yet flexible workflow. Here's a breakdown of the key steps I implemented:

### 1. Initial Data Cleaning
The first priority was to ensure the dataset was clean and reliable. I performed a thorough scan for missing or null values and removed them to avoid skewed insights during the analysis phase.

### 2. Feature Enrichment
To extract deeper time-based insights, I engineered a few additional columns:
- **`time_of_day`**: Classified each transaction as occurring in the Morning, Afternoon, or Evening based on the `time` field.
- **`day_name`**: Derived the weekday name (e.g., Monday, Saturday) from each transaction's `date`.
- **`month_name`**: Extracted the full month name for trend identification over longer periods.

These new features helped segment the data meaningfully for time series patterns and customer behavior analysis.

### 3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
With a clean and enriched dataset, I dived into exploratory analysis using SQL queries. The goal was to uncover patterns, outliers, and correlations. Some of the focal points included:
- Identifying the highest grossing branches and products
- Comparing sales across different times of day and days of the week
- Analyzing customer type and gender distribution
- Understanding payment method preferences
- Studying the seasonal or monthly sales fluctuations
- Looking at tax/VAT contributions and gross margins

### 4. üìà Insight Derivation
The trends observed during EDA were compiled into actionable insights. For example, understanding peak shopping times and high-revenue locations helped form conclusions about potential operational improvements and sales strategy optimization.

This approach ensured that the analysis wasn‚Äôt just about writing queries‚Äîit focused on deriving real-world business insights from structured data.
